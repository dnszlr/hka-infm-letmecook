  "description": "Barbecue Ribs are a popular American dish made with pork ribs and a flavorful barbecue sauce. The ribs are seasoned with a dry rub made from brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. They are then slow-cooked on a grill or in the oven until tender and juicy. Before serving, the ribs are coated with a generous amount of barbecue sauce for added flavor. It's a finger-licking good dish that is often enjoyed at backyard cookouts and summer gatherings."
